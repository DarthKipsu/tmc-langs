Framework for supporting different programming languages in [TMC](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server).

WIP - not yet in use.

The idea is to define a Java interface that encapsulates everything needed to support a new language in TMC.
The framework will include CLI wrappers for most tasks so that it's fairly convenient to call from
other languages like Ruby.
